Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data's course project
=====================================================

In this repository you will find:

`CodeBook.md`: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data;

`run_analyzer.R`:  an R script that does the following:
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set;
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement;
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set;
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names;
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

`UCI_HAR_tidy.csv`: the tidy data set created by `run_analyzer.R`;

`README.md`: this file.
